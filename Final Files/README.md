# Habit Tracker
A habit tracker is used to track habits. These habits could be either daily habits or weekly habits.

5 Dummy habits along with their checkpoints have initially been created for test.

The requirements file has been generated using the following command:
<code>pip freeze > requirements.txt</code> 

In order to run the code, you would need to install the python packages from the requirements file
You can use the pip package manager to do this.

To start, open up a terminal or a command prompt and navigate to the directory of your Python project. 
Once you are there, type the following command:
<code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code> 

The habit tracker is capable of the following:
- create a habit
- add checkpoints for the habits
- Show all habits
- Show the habits along with their checkpoints
- Current daily habits
- Current weekly habits
- Get longest run streak among daily and weekly habits
- longest run streak for a habit
- delete a habit
- get habits with broken streaks
- show a graph of selected habits

SQL Alchemy is used to create a database and store the database.

You can run the file in the terminal or the command prompt by typing 
<code>python3 Final.py </code>

You can also run your code inside an IDE such as PyCharm by right-clicking on the file and selecting run.
